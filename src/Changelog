    From: Philip Kelleher <pjk1939@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
    
    Added support for IBM Flash Adapter devices within the
    snap script.
    
    The script will check whether or not IBM Flash
    Adapters are currently loaded in the system. If so, the
    script will check them. If not, the script will do its
    normal operations.
    
    It will, then, check whether or not the rsxx-utils are
    installed on the system. If they are installed, the rs_cardreport
    application will be ran. If not, the script will print out
    a warning stating that IBM Flash Adapter information could
    not be gathered. The script will continue normally either
    way.

    Allow frequency sampling for given time periods.
    
    This patch adds an option [-t <time> ] for the --frequency action in
    ppc64_cpu so that users can specify the period in seconds over which
    they want to do frequency sampling.

    Acquire the dr_lock earlier in dr operations.
    
    The dr_lock used to serialize dr operations should be taken earlier.
    The current code takes the lock after opening the log file, this can
    lead to having multiple instances of drmgr writing to the file at the
    same time.
    
    To do this, the patch moves the taking and releasing of the dr_lock into
    the dr_init and dr_fini routines as well as cleans up main() to make
    unlocking easier to handle.

    Handle addition of timestamp information in the oops header. New format
    oops header has version in the same place as length in the old header.
    Version is assigned a value greater than oops partition size (illegal length)
    in kernel. If unzip_partition finds an illegal length, it will understand its

    option will work with both old and new-style headers.

    drmgr: Post processing for PCI replace
    
    During a PCI replace operation we can hit scenarios where the adapter
    was not able to completely clean everything up before it is removed.
    Such a scenario would be an adapter completely failing or just being
    pulled from its slot while the system is up.
    
    In these cases we need to add an additional remove and add to the flow
    of operations in the replace code path. This allows us to add the
    adapter back to the system which gives us enough to do a complete
    remove and clean everything up, and then add the adapter again.

    drmgr: Ensure devices are present during pci replacement
    
    In some instance during a PCI replacement operations (drmgr -c pci -R)
    the adapter we are adding does not immediately appear. In these cases
    a small wait is required for the adapter to appear.
    
    This patch adds a small loop checking for the adapter's presence before
    continuing the replace operation. The update also adds an option for
    users to exit the operation if the adapter does not appear.

    The say() logging function allocates a static 256 byte buffer for
    messages. Messages passed to say() larger than 256 bytes result in a
    truncated message followed by garbage from past the end of the buffer being
    written to the log file. This is a result of using the return value of
    vsnprintf as the length input to the write function. Despite only
    writing no more than 256 bytes (including the trailing \0) to the buffer
    the return value of vsnprintf is actually the total number of bytes (not
    including the trailing \0) that would have been written had the buffer
    been long enough.
    
    This patch checks for truncation, labels the end of the message
    stating as much, and corrects the message length passed to write.

    This patch changes logic around quanity requested and # sections removable
    for memory remove.  Previously, if you had requested X but some non-zero
    quantify less than X were available it would bail.  Now it will attempt
    to remove as many as are available.  For this case it is still considered
    a partial success and a non-zero (error) return code is given so that
    output is displayed on the management console.
    
    Messages for the memory remove code path are impoved and some message
    logging levels are changed.  Messages now indicate situations that are
    really bugs and should be looked at by support.  For those cases it also
    points the user to /var/log/drmgr for the debug logs.

    The drmgr command has always taken the -w option to specify
    how long to try an operation before timing out. Historically
    this option was always ignored, and then at some point used to
    time out when trying to acquire the drmgr lock.
    
    As we see larger systems coming around we need to start honoring
    this option so we do not consume unneeded time going through every
    possible LMB and CPU on the system.
    
    This patch saves the timeout specified on the command line (-w)
    and then checks it while trying to take the drmgr lock and before
    each CPU/LMB it tries to add/remove. If no timeout is specified
    then drmgr will never timeout.

    The drmgr command does not currently allow users to specify the drc index of
    the resource they wish to add/remove. This patch updates the drmgr command s
o
    that users can specify either a drc name or a drc index with the -s option.
    
    This functionality is needed for the upcoming userspace handling of PRRN RTA
S
    events. The rtas_errd will already have the drc index for the resources it
    needs, adding the capability to parse drc names from the device tree is not
    supported in rtas_errd though.

    The upstream kernel has a feature in the pseries PCI code called DDW
    that inserts TCEs transparently to device drivers. The upstream kernel
    was recently sent a fix for DLPAR that ensured those TCEs would get
    cleared upon DLPAR remove (http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/213735/),
    but for it to work, we need a corresponding change to drmgr for, at
    least, PHB remove, so that the notifier chain has fired before we call
    into the slot isolate code. Without such a change, there is no way to
    ensure the DDW TCEs are cleared, and the DLPAR will always fail.

    We have introduced full fledged Light Path Diagnostics support
    on PowerLinux. To bring all Light Path Diagnostics related
    code into common tree and re-use common functionalities across
    tools, we have re-implemented usysident/usysattn commands. Light
    Path Diagnostics including new implentation of usysident/usysattn
    will be hosted in PowerLinux diagnostic package (ppc64-diag).
    
    ppc64-diag source:
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-diag/files/ppc64-diag/
    
    This will introduce package conflict between ppc64-diag and
    powerpc-utils. To avoid the conflict we need to deprecate the
    usysident/usysattn commands from powerpc-utils.
    
    This patch deprecates usysident/usysattn commands.

    The latest kernels allow for users to get/set the DSCR value on a per proces
    This allows for more refined DSCR setting in applications. This is implement
    by using the ptrace peekuser capabilites in the kernel and simply doing a
    ptrace attach and peek from the ppc64_cpu command. Note: this does not actua
    stop the process we are attaching to while under ptrace control.
    
    The patch does a little more than just adding this functionality since the
    --dscr commad now takes an optional -p <pid> option. This required an
    updated to the command parsing code to allow this.
